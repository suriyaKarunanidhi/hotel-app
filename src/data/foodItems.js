    description: `The Margherita Pizza is a timeless Italian classic that captures the essence of simple yet profound flavors. 
    Crafted with a thin and crispy crust, it is topped with freshly made tomato sauce using ripe, sun-kissed tomatoes, 
    creamy mozzarella cheese that melts perfectly, and a generous garnish of fresh basil leaves. Each bite offers a harmonious 
    blend of the tangy tomato sauce, the richness of cheese, and the aromatic touch of basil. It's baked to perfection in a 
    stone oven to achieve a slight char on the crust, giving it a smoky depth of flavor. Ideal for vegetarians and pizza lovers 
    alike, the Margherita is a celebration of Italy's culinary heritage and a go-to dish for anyone seeking a taste of authenticity.`,
